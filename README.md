# Description
Includes fundamental concepts and techniques behind object-oriented programming. They include: abstract data types; creation, initialization, and destruction of objects; class hierarchies; polymorphism, inheritance and dynamic binding; generic programming using templates. As well as object-oriented view of data structures: linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, and algorithms such as searching and hashing.

# Topics Covered
1. Dynamic data structures
2. C++ class basics
3. Separate compilation and makefile
4. Constructors, destructor, initialization
5. Inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic binding
6. Generic programming
7. Namespace
8. Static member functions/data
9. rvalue reference and move semantics
10. Hashing
11. Binary search trees
12. STL

# Skills Involved
* Write and analyze object-oriented programs in C++ with object creation, destruction, member variables and functions, inheritance, polymorphism, and templates.
* Analyze simple problems and provide solutions with OOP.
* Understand the basic operations of data structures such as stacks, queues, lists, binary search trees, and hashes, and their implementations.
* Demonstrate the ability to use the learned data structures to solve problems in C++.
* Develop large programs using separate compilation, good OOP design, and code reuse through the use of inheritance, and generic programming.
